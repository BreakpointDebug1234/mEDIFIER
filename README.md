I just don't know why the Edifier Connect takes up more than 200MB on my phone.  

# Pros
+ Smaller  
  (Android: ~2MB, Qt(Android): ~9MB, Qt(PC): ~30MB)
+ No Internet is required

# Cons
+ Tested on W820NB and W820NB Plus only
+ Works for RFCOMM only  

# Previews
(All versions have both English And Simplified Chinese interfaces)
